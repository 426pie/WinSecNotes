# WinSecNotes
Here lies my Windows Security notes and learnings. All for educational and personal learning purposes.


 [Reflective DLL Loading](/ReflectiveLoader/) - Load and execute a PE file without the filedata touching disk

 [IAT Investigations](/IAT_Investigations/) - Investigating the structure of Import Addresss Table and how to parse it

 [Remap NTDLL](/remapNTDLL/) - Investigation into where ntdll functions are loaded in a process, and overwrite our local instance
 
 [CustomSyscall](/CustomSyscall/) - Investigation into how to call syscalls directly, without the help of Win API function. Inspired by Hell's Gate technique.
